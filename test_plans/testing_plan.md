# Unified Test Plan for E-commerce Web Application

## 1. Introduction

**Purpose:**  
This document outlines the strategy, objectives, and scope for both Integration and UI Testing of the e-commerce web application to ensure system interoperability and an intuitive user experience.

**Scope:**  
The testing encompasses the integration of various system components and the evaluation of user interface elements across different browsers and devices.

## 2. Test Objectives

**Integration Testing Objectives:**

- Validate the interaction between system modules.
- Ensure data consistency across integrated components.
- Assess error handling during module interactions.

**UI Testing Objectives:**

- Verify the usability and intuitiveness of the user interface.
- Ensure consistent design elements across pages.
- Validate responsiveness on various devices and browsers.

## 3. Test Strategy

**Integration Testing Approach:**

- **Levels:**
  - *Module Integration:* Testing interactions between related modules.
  - *System Integration:* Validating interactions with external systems, such as payment gateways.

- **Approaches:**
  - Top-Down Integration
  - Bottom-Up Integration
  - Big Bang Integration

**UI Testing Approach:**

- **Levels:**
  - *Smoke Testing:* Initial checks of UI functionality.
  - *Sanity Testing:* Verifying specific UI functionalities after changes.
  - *Regression Testing:* Ensuring new changes don't affect existing UI components.

- **Approaches:**
  - *Manual Testing:* Human interaction to identify usability issues.
  - *Automated Testing:* Using tools like Selenium for repetitive test cases.

## 4. Test Scope

**In-Scope:**

- **Integration Testing:**
  - Interactions between user authentication, product management, order processing, and payment modules.
  - Data flow between product catalog, inventory management, and order fulfillment systems.

- **UI Testing:**
  - Homepage layout and navigation.
  - Product page displays and functionalities.
  - Shopping cart and checkout processes.
  - User account management interfaces.

**Out-of-Scope:**

- Unit testing of individual modules.
- Performance testing under extreme load conditions.
