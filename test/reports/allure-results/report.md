# Test Reports for E-Commerce API and UI Testing

This directory contains test reports for both API and UI tests related to the E-Commerce system. The reports are generated using **Allure** for API tests and **HTML** reports for UI tests. Below are the details for understanding and updating the reports.

Generating Reports
1. Allure Reports:
Allure is used to generate detailed test reports. After running the tests, the results are stored in reports/allure-results/. Here are the steps to generate an Allure report:

Step 1: Install Allure
You need to have Allure installed to generate reports. Install it globally via npm:

bash
Copy
Edit
npm install -g allure-commandline
Step 2: Run the Tests
If you are using pytest to run your API tests, use the following command to generate the Allure results:

bash
Copy
Edit
pytest --alluredir=reports/allure-results
Step 3: Generate the Allure Report
Once the tests have been executed, generate the Allure report:

bash
Copy
Edit
allure serve reports/allure-results
This will open a browser window where you can view the interactive report.

2. HTML Reports:
HTML reports are used for the results of UI tests (or for Postman API testing). If you are using Newman (Postman CLI tool) to run your Postman collections, use the following command:

Step 1: Install Newman
Install Newman using npm:

bash
Copy
Edit
npm install -g newman
Step 2: Run the Postman Collection
Run the Postman collection using the following command:

bash
Copy
Edit
newman run ecommerce-api-collection.json --reporters cli,html --reporter-html-export reports/html/api_report.html
This command will generate an HTML report located in reports/html/ under api_report.html. You can open this file in any browser to view the results.

Logs
Logs are saved in the logs/ directory. Each test run will generate a log file containing the details of the execution. For example:

plaintext
Copy
Edit
reports/logs/test_log_2023-10-15.log
This file contains detailed information about the tests, including errors and any potential issues during test execution.

Example of Test Results
When running your tests, you should see output similar to the following for both Allure and Newman:

Allure Example:
bash
Copy
Edit
=========================== test session starts ============================
collected 4 items

api_tests/test_get_orders.py .. [100%]
api_tests/test_place_order.py .. [100%]
api_tests/test_update_order.py .. [100%]
api_tests/test_delete_order.py .. [100%]

=========================== All tests passed! =============================
Newman Example:
bash
Copy
Edit
=========================== test session starts ============================
collected 4 items

api_tests/test_get_orders.py .. [100%]
api_tests/test_place_order.py .. [100%]
api_tests/test_update_order.py .. [100%]
api_tests/test_delete_order.py .. [100%]

=========================== All tests passed! =============================
Conclusion
By following these steps, you can successfully generate and view detailed test reports for both API and UI testing. The Allure reports provide an interactive visual overview of your tests, while the HTML reports give a simple format for easy viewing in a browser.
