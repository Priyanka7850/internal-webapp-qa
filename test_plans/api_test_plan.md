# API Test Plan for E-commerce Web Application

## 1. Introduction

**Purpose:**  
This document outlines the strategy, scope, and objectives for testing the APIs of the e-commerce web application to ensure they meet specified requirements and function correctly.

**Scope:**  
The testing will cover all public and internal APIs, including user authentication, product management, order processing, and payment gateways.

## 2. Test Objectives

- **Functional Testing:** Ensure APIs perform the required operations correctly.
- **Security Testing:** Verify that APIs are secure from unauthorized access and data breaches.
- **Performance Testing:** Assess the responsiveness and stability of APIs under load.
- **Usability Testing:** Evaluate the ease of use and clarity of API documentation.
- **Compatibility Testing:** Ensure APIs function correctly across different devices, browsers, and operating systems.

## 3. Test Strategy

**Types of Testing:**
